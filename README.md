Assignment Week 8: Day 1 - Create new Kitty (Building upon previous assignments - see below)
1. Write a public createKittyGen0(uint256 _genes) function, that employs a private _createkitty function.
2. Ensure that createKittyGen0() can only be called by the contract owner.
3. Get Kitty  - Part 2 is to Implement a getKitty() function in the contract. It should take a kitty id and return all the information on that kitty.
